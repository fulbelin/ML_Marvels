# Article Summary Web Application

## Overview

This project is an end-to-end machine learning application that summarizes articles and sends them to users via email. The application allows users to select topics of interest, and then it automatically generates summaries of articles related to those topics. These summaries are then sent to the users' email addresses.

## Features

- Summarization of articles: The application uses machine learning techniques to generate concise summaries of articles.
- Email integration: Users can provide their email addresses and receive summaries directly in their inbox.
- Topic selection: Users can choose which topics they are interested in, and the application will prioritize articles related to those topics for summarization.

## Technologies Used

- Python: The backend of the application is built using Python, utilizing various libraries such as Flask for the web framework and NLTK for natural language processing.
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript: The frontend interface is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a user-friendly experience.
- Machine learning: The summarization model is built using machine learning algorithms, leveraging libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- Email APIs: The application integrates with email APIs (e.g., Gmail API) to send summaries to users' email addresses.
